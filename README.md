# SHA-256 Encrypted Sign-In System
A repository to learn about a simple SHA-256 encrypted log in system.

I created this repository (and mini project, you can say) to learn more about the SHA-256 basic concepts hands-on. The best implementation for learning was a sign-in system based on SHA-256 encryption and hence, here I am.

## What is SHA-256?

SHA-256 is an encryption algorithm used to keep your data safe. In simple words, it converts your data into a "hash" value, which can be stored on databases and no one but you can have access to view your data because it is in a "virtually impossible to read" format.

## Setting up the Project

First, set up a server, either virtual or local and then clone the github project on to your destination. 

Once you've done that, create a MySQL Database. When you have your database credentials, proceed to the next step.

There's clearly outlined variables in each of the account creation and sign in pages, just change those variable values to the credentials you obtained in the previous step and run the application.
