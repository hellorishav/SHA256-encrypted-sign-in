# SHA-256 Encrypted Sign-In System
A repository to learn about a simple SHA-256 encrypted log in system.

I created this repository (and mini project, you can say) to learn more about the SHA-256 basic concepts hands-on. The best implementation for learning was a sign-in system based on SHA-256 encryption and hence, here I am.
